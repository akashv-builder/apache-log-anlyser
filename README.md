The log data generated by your Apache HTTP server is a goldmine of information. Using this information, you can judge your server's usage, pinpoint areas of weakness, and devise ways to improve server structure and overall performance. Auditing your Apache logs can come in handy in the following cases, among others:

Identifying and correcting frequent errors to enhance user experience.
Monitoring anomalous or suspicious activity, which can be investigated further.
Understanding who your users are and how they access your site.
Preempting security attacks on your server.
